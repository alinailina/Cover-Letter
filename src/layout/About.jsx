          My name is Alina Ilina. Iâ€™m a Web Developer and UI Imagineer (a
          portmanteau title I borrowed from{" "}
          <a

          , as I believe user interfaces tell a story, and nothing is more
          important to a good narrative than imagination).
        </p>
        <p>
          I combine my passion for UI design and development to help brands
          create digital experiences for a long-lasting emotional connection
          with their audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My strong interests in usability, web accessibility and interaction
          design inform my work as a Developer. I believe less is more and
          strive for depth through simplicity in web and mobile applications.
          Making everything obvious or self-explanatory is my ultimate goal as a
          Developer and a Human.
